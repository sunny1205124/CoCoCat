# CoCoCat
### **A concept-generative fine-mapping method from causal diagram perspective**
Although the genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified thousands of reproducible genetic associations for complex diseases, the high false discovery rates (FDR) is still a challenge to the geneticists. The strategy of fine-mapping provides the possibility to accurately identify the causal genetic variants. We present a Concept-generative multi-stage GWAS fine mapping method with each stage performing Conditional regression by accounting for all the possible Causal diagram structure (CoCoCat). This repository contains the code for CoCoCat.
